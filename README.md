# Ontology Alignment Curation App

This repository supports a pairwise + SQLite ontology alignment workflow and now includes a Streamlit app to run the full pipeline with intermediate previews and exports.

## Install dependencies 

### System dependencies

#### Raptor


**Linux**
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libraptor2-dev

# Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install raptor2-devel

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S raptor

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install raptor-devel
```

**macOS**
```bash
brew install raptor
```

**Windows**

No native package manager support. Options:
- Install via [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/raptor2): `conda install -c conda-forge raptor2`
- Or use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) and follow the Linux instructions above

### Python (uv)

```bash
uv sync
```

## System requirements

- Required: `rapper` CLI (from Raptor RDF toolkit) for TTL extraction.

Install examples:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install raptor

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y raptor2-utils
```

## Run the app

```bash
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Modules

- Overview
- Fetch schemas and ontologies - Download external sources + browse OLS catalog
- Extract term TSV from TTL
- Generate pairwise candidates (local/local or local/OLS)
- Curate candidate decisions (quick actions + batch edits)
- Review curated dataset and export TTL
- View schema documentation (pyLODE), interactive graph, RDFGlance linkout, and Mermaid export before/after curation
- Background sync - candidate TSVs are synced automatically to SQLite and reconciled exports
- Inspect SQLite tables and run SQL queries

## Ontology Terms Glossary

- `Ontologies`: distinct vocabularies/knowledge models loaded in OLS (for example CHEBI, EDAM, BIOLINK).
- `Classes`: concept types in those ontologies (for example `chemical entity`, `analysis`, `sample`).
- `Properties`: relationship or attribute predicates used to connect/describe entities (for example `part_of`, `has_role`, `label`).
- `Individuals`: concrete instances (named entities) rather than concept types.

## Versioned curation files

Keep these in Git:

- `registry/external_sources.tsv`
- `registry/pair_alignment_candidates_<source>.tsv`

Each schema should have one TSV that contains:

- approved review decisions

This versioned TSV is the shared review ledger and SSOT for exports.
It is kept deterministically sorted by `source_term_iri` and written with LF line endings so Git diffs stay row-local.

Minimal shared ledger columns:

- `source_term_source`
- `source_term_iri`
- `source_term_label`
- `source_term_kind`
- `canonical_term_iri`
- `canonical_term_label`
- `canonical_term_source`
- `canonical_term_kind`
- `relation` (optional semantic mapping metadata)
- `status`
- `curator`
- `curator_name`
- `reviewer`
- `reviewer_name`
- `date_reviewed`
- `curation_comment`

## Local generated artefacts

Do not version these generated caches/exports:

- `registry/alignment_curation.sqlite`
- `registry/reconciled_mappings.tsv`
- `registry/reconciled_canonical_groups.tsv`
- `registry/pair_alignments.tsv`
- `registry/downloads/`
- `registry/imports/*_terms.tsv`
- `registry/exports/`
- `registry/work/`
- `registry/ols_ontologies.tsv`
- `registry/ols_ontologies_meta.json`
- `registry/mapping_relations_catalog.json`
- `registry/schema_docs/`

`registry/work/pair_alignment_candidates_<source>.tsv` is the local working queue.
Use it for focused regeneration and in-progress curation. Only approved decisions are synced back to the shared ledger.

## Collaboration workflow (git + PR)

Use shared schema files (no per-curator filenames) and collaborate through branches/PRs.

1. Pull latest `main` and create a branch: `curation/<schema>-<short-topic>`.
2. In the app sidebar, select:
   - `Source ID` (schema you curate)
   - `Curator ORCID` (must resolve to a public ORCID name)
3. The shared review ledger for that schema is:
   - `registry/pair_alignment_candidates_<source>.tsv`
4. Generate and curate locally in:
   - `registry/work/pair_alignment_candidates_<source>.tsv`
5. Commit only the finalized shared ledger plus any intentional manifest edits:
   - `registry/pair_alignment_candidates_<source>.tsv`
6. Open a PR with a short summary:
   - schema curated
   - terms reviewed
   - notable manual additions/rejections
7. Reviewer checks diff + app preview, then merges.

Notes:
- `curator` may be `auto` or a valid ORCID. When it is an ORCID, `curator_name` stores the public ORCID name.
- `reviewer` must be a valid ORCID on reviewed rows. `reviewer_name` stores the public ORCID name.
- Reviewer attribution is stored in TSV `reviewer`/`reviewer_name`/`date_reviewed` fields.
- SQLite/reconciled exports are local cache files and should not be manually edited or committed.
- Focused local regeneration is safe because `needs_review` queue rows stay under `registry/work/`.
